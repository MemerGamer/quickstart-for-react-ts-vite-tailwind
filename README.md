2. Basic knowledge of programming concepts such as variables, functions, and objects

## What will you learn?

1. Basic Usage of JavaScript
2. Basic Usage of TypeScript
3. Using React with TypeScript
4. TailwindCSS with React

In the end you will be able to create a React application with TypeScript and TailwindCSS like this: [Example App](https://github.com/MemerGamer/vite-react-ts-tailwind-example)

**Note**: In the example app we also use [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) which is not covered in this quickstart guide.
In summary ViteJS is frontend tool that is used for building fast and optimized web applications. It uses a modern build system and a fast development server to provide a streamlined and efficient development experience.
